# Frontend-3

Material for **Front-end 3 (data)**, mostly using [d3.js][d3].

Examples and assignments are in this Git repository. Course related
info can be found on Moodle.

## 0. Install

With [git][], do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CMDA/Frontend-3.git
```

**Or, click the big green button “Clone or download” and
install from there. Don’t forget to `cd` into the directory.**

## 1. Get Node

You need [Node][] installed.
If you haven’t already we suggest to install the LTS version.

## 2. Dependencies

Now, install dependencies with npm like so:

```sh
npm install
```

## 3. Server

Finally, to start a live-reloading server, run the following:

```sh
npm start
```

This will print out an address the server is running on.

This server is made with [budo][]. <small>Tip: you can
pass budo options, such as `--open`, like so:
`npm start -- --open`</small>
